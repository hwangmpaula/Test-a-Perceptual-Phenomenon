# Test-a-Perceptual-Phenomenon

### Project Overview
In this project, you will investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect. You will learn a little bit about the experiment, create a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, then go through the task yourself. You will then look at some data collected from others who have performed the same task and will compute some statistics describing the results. Finally, you will interpret your results in terms of your hypotheses.

If you need a refresher on statistics, you can take a free Statistics course from Udacity!

### Why this project?
Statistics is a major component of data analysis. Understanding statistics allows you to investigate data and make inferences based on your observations. A foundation in statistics also allows you to be a critical consumer of analyses that others perform, as well as the conclusions they have drawn.

### What will I learn?
This project will review the basic concepts of statistics, including:

- How to identify components of an experiment
- How to use descriptive statistics to describe qualities of a sample
- How to set up a hypothesis test, make inferences from a sample, and draw conclusions based on the results
